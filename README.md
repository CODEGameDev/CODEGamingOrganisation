## CODE Gaming Organsiation

This is the page of CO:GO. We are students of CODE University of Applied Science in Berlin, and we :heart: games.

Our goal here is to work on mods, addons and maybe even full-fledge games -- of course all with publicly available source codes and a free license, because we :heart: copyleft.

## Current Projects

### CO:GO :heart: Garry's Mod

We have an active Garry's Mod server running, and we are eagerly creating addons for it.
Our current self-made addons are:
- [CODE Soundgun](https://github.com/CODEGameDev/CODE-Soundgun)
- [Walk-Forcer](https://github.com/CODEGameDev/Walk-Forcer)
- [Russian Roulette](https://github.com/CODEGameDev/Russian-Roulette)
With even more in the conception stage!
